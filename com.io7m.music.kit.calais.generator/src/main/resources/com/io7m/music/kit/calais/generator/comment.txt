Calais ${project.version}

The old part of the town, Calais proper (known as Calais-Nord),
is situated on an artificial island surrounded by canals and
harbours. The modern part of the town, St-Pierre, lies to the south
and south-east. In the centre of the old town is the Place d'Armes,
in which stands the Tour du Guet, or watch-tower, a structure built
in the 13th century, which was used as a lighthouse until 1848 when
a new lighthouse was built by the port. South east of the Place
is the church of Notre-Dame, built during the English occupancy
of Calais. Arguably, it is the only church built in the English
perpendicular style in all of France. In this church, former French
President Charles de Gaulle married his wife, Yvonne Vendroux. South
of the Place and opposite the Parc St Pierre is the HÃ´tel-de-ville
(the town hall), and the belfry from the early 20th century. Today,
Calais is visited by more than 10 million annually. Aside from being a
key transport hub, Calais is also a notable fishing port and a centre
for fish marketing, and some 3,000 people are still employed in the
lace industry for which the town is also famed.
